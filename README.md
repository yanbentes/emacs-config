## My Emacs configuration files

Hi, just started using emacs. Currently learning and using evil-mode.

Currently it's not working properly, but eventualy I will figure this out(i hope).

`(require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
    (package-initialize)`

    `(require 'evil)
      (evil-mode 1)')`
